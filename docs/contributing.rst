Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `esm-tools` packages for local development (see :ref:`packages:Python Packages` for a list of available packages). Note that the procedure of contributing to the `esm_tools` package (see :ref:`contributing:Contribution to esm_tools Package`) is different from the one to contribute to the other packages (:ref:`contributing:Contribution to other Packages`).

Contribution to esm_tools Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Fork the `esm_tools` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone https://github.com/esm-tools/esm_tools.git

   (or whatever subproject you want to contribute to).

3. By default, ``git clone`` will give you the release branch of the project. You might want to consider checking out the development branch, which might not always be as stable, but usually more up-to-date than the release branch::

    $ git checkout develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8::

    $ flake8 esm_tools

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Contribution to Other Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Follow steps 1-4 in :ref:`contributing:Contribution to esm_tools Package`
   for the desired package, cloning your fork locally with::

   $ git clone https://github.com/esm-tools/<PACKAGE>.git

2. Proceed to do a development install of the package in the package's folder::

   $ cd <package's_folder>
   $ pip install -e .

3. From now on when binaries are called, they will refer to the source code you are working
   on, located in your local package's folder. For example, if you are editing the
   package `esm_master` located in ``~/esm_master`` and you run ``$ esm_master install-fesom-2.0``
   you'll be using the edited files in ``~/esm_master`` to install FESOM 2.0.

4. Follow steps 5-7 in :ref:`contributing:Contribution to esm_tools Package`.

Implementing a New Model
------------------------

1. Upload your model into a repository such us `gitlab.awi.de`, `gitlab.dkrz.de` or `github`.
   Make sure to set up the right access permissions, so that you comply with the licensing of
   the software you are uploading.

2. If you are interested in implementing more than one version of the model, we recommend you
   to commit them to the master branch in the order they were developed, and that you create
   a tag per version. For example:

   a. Clone the empty master branch you just created and add your model files to it::

      $ git clone https://<your_repository>
      $ cp -rf <your_model_files_for_given_version> <your_repository_folder>
      $ git add .

   b. Commit, tag the version and push the changes to your repository::

      $ git commit -m "your comment here"
      $ git tag -a <version_id> -m "your comment about the version"
      $ git push -u origin <your_master_branch>
      $ git push origin <version_id>

   c. Repeat steps `a` and `b` for all the versions that you would like to be present in
      ESM-Tools.

3. Now that you have your model in a repository you are ready to implement it into `esm_tools`.
   First, you will need to create your own branch of `esm_tools`, following the steps 1-4 in
   :ref:`contributing:Contribution to esm_tools Package`.

4. Then you will need to create a folder for your model inside the ``configs`` folder in your
   `esm_tools` branch, and create a `yaml` file per version of your model::

    $ mkdir <PATH>/esm_tools/configs/<model>
    $ touch <PATH>/esm_tools/configs/<model>/<model-version>.yaml

   These `yaml` files need to exist for `esm_master` to download and compile your model, but they can
   be empty. However, you can choose to fill them with a basic configuration::

    # YOUR_MODEL YAML CONFIGURATION FILE
    #

    model: your_model
    branch: your_model_branch_in_your_repo
    version: "the_version_of_your_model"

    comp_executable: your_model_bin
    executable: your_model_command

    setup_dir: "${model_dir}"
    bin_dir: "${setup_dir}/the_location_of_your_model_bin"

5. Use your favourite text editor to open and edit ``setups2models.yaml`` in the ``configs/esm_master/``
   folder::

   $ <your_text_editor> <PATH>/esm_tools/configs/esm_master/setups2models.yaml

6. The information of your model should be placed inside the ``components`` chapter of the file and
   be correctly aligned with the other components. You can use the following example as a template::

    components:
            [...]
            "your_model":
                    install_bins: "path_to_the_binaries"
                    git-repository: "https://your_repository.git"
                    choose_version:
                           "1.0.0":
                                   branch: "1.0.0"
                           "1.0.1":
                                   branch: "1.0.1"
                           "1.0.2":
                                   branch: "develop"
                    available_versions:
                           - "1.0.0"
                           - "1.0.1"
                           - "1.0.2"
                    comp_command: "your_commands_for_compiling"
                    clean_command: "${defaults.clean_command}"

            [...]

   In the ``install_bins`` key you need to indicate the path inside your model folder where the
   binaries are compiled to, so that `esm_master` can find them once compiled. The ``choose_version``
   key relates version labels with their particular configurations, in this case only the ``branch``
   (or tag) where they are located in your repository. The ``available_versions`` key is needed for
   `esm_master` to list the versions of your model when called without input (``$ esm_master``).
   The ``comp_command`` key indicates the command needed to compile your model, and can be set as
   ``${defaults.comp_command}`` for a default command
   (``mkdir -p build; cd build; cmake ..;   make install -j `nproc --all```), or you can define your
   own list of compiling commands separated with ``;`` (``"command1; command2"``). Note that this is
   just an example of a model configuration, but the parser used by `esm_tools` to read `yaml` files
   (`esm_parser`) allows for a lot of flexibility in their configuration; i.e., imagine that the
   different versions of your model are in different repositories, instead of in different branches,
   and their path to the binaries are also different. Then you can remove the ``git-repository`` and
   ``install_bins`` subsections from the general model section (``"your_model"``), and place their
   particular configuration in their corresponding version inside the ``choose_version`` subsection.

7. You can now check if `esm_master` can list and install your model correctly::

    $ esm_master

   This command should return, without errors, a list of available models and versions including yours.
   Then you can actually try installing your model in the desire folder::

    $ mkdir ~/model_codes
    $ cd ~/model_codes
    $ esm_master install-your_model-version

8. If everything works correctly you can check that your changes pass `flake8`, commit your changes, push
   them to the ``origin`` and submit a pull request through GitHub (see steps 5-7 in
   :ref:`contributing:Contribution to esm_tools Package`).

Implementing a New Coupled Setup
--------------------------------

1. Make sure the models, couplers and versions you want to use, are already available for `esm_master`
   to install them (``$ esm_master`` and check the list). If something is missing you will need to
   add it following the instructions in :ref:`contributing:Implementing a New Model`.

2. Once everything you need is available to `esm_master`, you will need to create your own branch of
   `esm_tools`, following the steps 1-4 in :ref:`contributing:Contribution to esm_tools Package`.

3. Then you will need to create a folder for your coupled setup inside the ``configs`` folder, and
   create a `yaml` file per version of your setup::

    $ mkdir <PATH>/esm_tools/configs/<setup>
    $ touch <PATH>/esm_tools/configs/<setup>/<setup-version>.yaml

   These `yaml` files need to exist for `esm_master` to download and compile your coupled setup, but
   they can be empty. However, you can choose to fill them with a basic configuration::

    # YOUR_SETUP YAML CONFIGURATION FILE
    #

    model: your_setup
    version: "your_setup_version"

4. Use your favourite text editor to open and edit ``setups2models.yaml`` in the ``configs/esm_master/``
   folder::

   $ <your_text_editor> <PATH>/esm_tools/configs/esm_master/setups2models.yaml

5. The information of your coupled setup should be placed inside the ``setups`` chapter of the file and
   be correctly aligned with the other setups. You can use the following example as a template::

    setups:
            [...]
            your_setup:
                         available_versions:
                                 - "1.0.0"
                                 - "1.0.1"

                         choose_version:
                                 "1.0.0":
                                         couplings:
                                                 - "model1-1.0+model2-1.0"
                                 "1.0.1":
                                         couplings:
                                                 - "model1-1.1+model2-1.1"

            [...]

   The ``available_versions`` key is needed for `esm_master` to label and list the versions of your setup
   when called without input (``$ esm_master``). The ``choose_version`` key relates version labels with
   their particular configurations. In this example, each version contains only the parameter
   ``couplings`` that consist of a label that points to a coupling configuration, contained in another
   chapter of ``setups2models.yaml``.

6. Now you need to include the different coupling configurations into the ``couplings`` chapter of the
   ``setups2models.yaml``. You can use the following example as a template::

    couplings:
            "model1-1.0+model2-1.0":
                    components:
                            - "model1-1.0"
                            - "model2-1.0"
                            - "coupler-version"
                    coupling_changes:
                            - "sed -i '/MODEL1_PARAMETER/s/OFF/ON/g' model1-1.0/file_to_change"
                            - "sed -i '/MODEL2_PARAMETER/s/OFF/ON/g' model2-1.0/file_to_change"

            [...]

   Remember to do this with all the couplings required from your setup versions in the ``setups``
   chapter. The ``components`` subsection should list the models and couplers used for the given coupling,
   including their required version, in the same way they are labelled in the ``components`` chapter of
   ``setups2models.yaml``. The ``coupling_changes`` subsection should include a list of commands to make
   the necessary changes in the component's make files, for a correct compilation of the coupled setup.

7. You can now check if `esm_master` can list and install your coupled setup correctly::

    $ esm_master

   This command should return, without errors, a list of available setups and versions including yours.
   Then you can actually try installing your setup in the desire folder::

    $ mkdir ~/model_codes
    $ cd ~/model_codes
    $ esm_master install-your_setup-version

8. If everything works correctly you can check that your changes pass `flake8`, commit your changes, push
   them to the ``origin`` and submit a pull request through GitHub (see steps 5-7 in
   :ref:`contributing:Contribution to esm_tools Package`).

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.

2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.

3. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, and for PyPy. Check
   https://travis-ci.com/dbarbi/esm_tools/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
